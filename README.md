# Project findings:

1. Top countries with the highest medical professional density do not necessarily have the highest life expectancy
2. In Europe, a clearer positive correlation between medical professional density and life expectancy.
3. In general, the relationship between medical service density differ across all continents.

> The discrepancy suggests that while access to healthcare providers is undoubtedly crucial, other determinants are also important:
* Quality of healthcare systems
* Healthcare infrastructure, socioeconomics factors (income, education, employment, opportunities, and social support networks)
* Lifestyle choices (Nutrition, diet, etc.)
* Environmental conditions (air and water quality)
